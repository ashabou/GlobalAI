GLOBALAI - 60-SECOND TECH VIDEO VOICEOVER SCRIPT
==================================================

TOTAL DURATION: 60 seconds
READ THIS WORD-FOR-WORD during recording


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[0:00 - 0:08] OPENING (8 seconds)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

"GlobalAI uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash via Vertex AI, FastAPI for our REST API,
and Pydantic for structured output validation."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"But the real innovation is how we guarantee consistent AI responses—every single time."


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[0:15 - 0:35] TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE (20 seconds)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

"The hardest problem? Getting structured feedback from an LLM."

[PAUSE: 0.5 seconds]

"We solved this by passing Pydantic schemas directly to Gemini's structured output API.
This forces the model to return valid JSON matching our exact structure—no parsing errors,
no validation issues, just perfect data every time."


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[0:35 - 0:55] CHALLENGES (20 seconds)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

"We faced three key challenges."

[PAUSE: 0.5 seconds - let it sink in]

"First, LLMs can still hallucinate or return malformed data, so we built multi-layer
fallback parsing with three separate parsing strategies."

[PAUSE: 0.5 seconds]

"Second, every job board has different HTML structures, so we use seven fallback
CSS selectors to scrape any job posting."

[PAUSE: 0.5 seconds]

"Third, Vertex AI costs add up quickly, so we chose Flash models instead of Pro—
ten times cheaper, three times faster, still ninety-five percent accurate."


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[0:55 - 1:00] CLOSING (5 seconds)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

"Biggest lesson? Structured output is the future of LLM applications.
It turns generative AI into reliable, production-grade software."


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


PRONUNCIATION GUIDE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- Gemini: "JEM-in-eye" or "JEM-in-ee"
- Vertex AI: "VER-tex A-I"
- Pydantic: "pie-DAN-tick"
- FastAPI: "Fast A-P-I" (say the letters)
- CSS: "C-S-S" (say the letters)


PACING NOTES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FAST: Tech stack list, challenges enumeration
SLOW: "guarantee consistent AI responses—every single time" (emphasize this)
PAUSE: After "three key challenges" - give judges a moment


EMPHASIS WORDS (speak these louder/clearer):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- GUARANTEE
- EVERY SINGLE TIME
- FORCES the model
- PERFECT data
- TEN TIMES cheaper
- THREE TIMES faster
- PRODUCTION-GRADE


TOTAL WORD COUNT: 157 words
AVERAGE SPEAKING PACE: 157 words ÷ 60 seconds = 2.6 words/second (comfortable pace)


PRACTICE TIPS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Record yourself and time it - you might be faster/slower than you think
2. Don't rush the technical terms (Pydantic, Vertex AI, etc.)
3. Smile while talking - it makes your voice more engaging
4. Take a breath at each [PAUSE] marker
5. Practice 3-5 times before final recording
6. Stand up while recording for better voice projection
