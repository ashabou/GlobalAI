My solo show at Spectrum Gallery features 20 pieces that explore the intersection of human creativity and algorithmic patterns.\n\nI'm deeply grateful to gallery director Elena Rodriguez and my technical collaborator Dr. Ben Carter for their unwavering support and inspiration throughout this creative process.\n\nThe exhibition is more than just a display of artwork; it's a conversation about the future of art and technology. I'm excited to share this body of work with the community and continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in art.",
