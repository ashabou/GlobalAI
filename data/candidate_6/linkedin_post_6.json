        "text": "Team Captain - This season has been a defining chapter in my athletic journey—one that taught me the true meaning of leadership and perseverance. Leading our university team alongside Maria Schmidt and Thomas Bauer showed me what authentic teamwork, resilience, and focused determination can achieve.\n\nI'm particularly grateful to Coach Werner Hofmann and Dr. Anna Berger, whose guidance in strategic training, mental preparation, and performance under pressure has been transformative.\n\nBeyond the medals and records, what truly mattered was the team spirit: lifting each other up, growing together, and transforming every setback into a stepping stone. These are lessons that extend far beyond the track.",
