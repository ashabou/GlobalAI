Leading our team together with Nickolaj and Atuf Eren showed me what true collaboration, resilience, and focus under pressure look like.\n\nI’m especially grateful to Manfred Lang and Philipp Rubner, whose guidance in project management, moderation, and stress handling left a lasting impact.\n\nMore than the event itself, what mattered most was the spirit of the team: supporting each other, growing together, and turning challenges into lessons. An experience I’ll always carry forward.",
